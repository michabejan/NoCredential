I wanted to create a project where you don't need to login with passwords. So we are using a fingerprint to indetify the user. 
I used different techniques to accomplish this. 

When you are logged in, you can exchange data with different ppl. 

* spring boot + thymeleaf + hibernate + fingerprint2.js + qrcode (client for mobile phone will be uploaded, need to fix some stuff. )
